# Julia-set

The Julia set is the set of all complex numbers, z, for which the function f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c converges under iteration. Each pixel is mapped to a complex number, a + bi, where a and b are determined by the pixel's location. In the sketch, the constant c is determined by the position of the mouse.
